As wished by many, the FRONTLINE - Trenches without guns stand alone version.


Featuring
- The classic trench (normal and steep version - fillpercentage 80%, highly vulnerable to explosions) with steps (lower cover but quicker exit) and a ladder (fastest exit but also lower cover)

- New Sandbags (only cost some cloth, but just got fillpercentage of 50 %)

- A Razorwire (slows down your enemys)

-Trench Dirt, Trench Floor and the "no man's land" (slows down people)
