[b]The release of RimWorld 1.6 added improved support for [url=https://github.com/emipa606/AssetBuilder/blob/main/README.md]Asset Bundles[/url][/b].
To avoid doubling the size of the mod, it was re-released using only Asset Bundles, you can find the previous version of this mod [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2471431871]here[/url].

- Fixed some icon and blueprint size-differences

As wished by many, the FRONTLINE - Trenches without guns stand alone version.


Featuring
- The classic trench (normal and steep version - fillpercentage 80%, highly vulnerable to explosions) with steps (lower cover but quicker exit) and a ladder (fastest exit but also lower cover)

- New Sandbags (only cost some cloth, but just got fillpercentage of 50 %)

- A Razorwire (slows down your enemys)

-Trench Dirt, Trench Floor and the "no man's land" (slows down people)
